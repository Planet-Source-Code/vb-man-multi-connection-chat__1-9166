### Description

This is a multi connection chat using winsock. It supports multi-user, coloured chat windows, private messages, and will even display all the tasks running on another clients PC (but you'll have to look in the code for the command =). Each client displays the entry and exit of other clients, as well as maintaining a listbox of current users. Also included is a mIRC like entry box where you can use the up and down arrows to access recent commands. Please leave any suggestions. This is my first post here and a work in progress. Any suggestions will be appreciated.
